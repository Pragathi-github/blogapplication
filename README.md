# Interior Design App (Group Project)

This is a full-stack application for an interior design service booking system. It allows users to browse designs, book services, and manage their appointments through a personal dashboard.

This was a collaborative project developed by a team of three:
- Pragathi Poojary 
- Chethan T N
- Ruthvij

## My Contributions

As part of the team, my primary responsibilities were focused on the **backend development**. Specifically, I:

-   Designed and implemented the **RESTful API** using Node.js and Express.js.
-   Developed the **user authentication** system with secure login and registration.
-   Created the database schema and logic for the **booking system**.
-   Wrote the API endpoints for creating, reading, and managing user bookings.

**Note:** The original repository was managed by a team member, which is why their account is shown in the commit history. This forked version is to showcase my specific contributions to the project.
